        <!-- <p>MYPIE is owned and operated by chef Chris Brumby who is serving up quality British-styled foods with a unique Australian twist. He is influenced by the flavours of his heritage to make MYPIE’s weekly offerings unique and delicious.
        </p>
        <p>Chris is a trained chef who cut his teeth (so to speak) doing a four year apprenticeship in a Michelin equivalent restaurant and was Head Chef at 23 at The Horseshoe (Camden brewery home).  He also did a short stint with Street           Kitchen in 2012, and more recently in 2014, he was the Executive Chef at Ben's Canteen.

        <p>As a VW Camper enthusiast he’s owned two in the UK - the first he drove to Rome, and in 2014 he circumnavigated France. These days when Chris isn’t working he spends time with his family and friends -  eating home cooked meals and often with vegetables that were grown in the garden.
